# Coffee-Shop-Sales
Project Overview: I developed a comprehensive sales report for a coffee shop to provide insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and financial data, helping stakeholders make informed business decisions.
 
Requirement Gathering: The requirement gathering phase involved identifying and documenting the key needs and expectations of stakeholders to ensure the sales report provides valuable insights. Key areas of focus included:
 
◾Sales Performance
◾Customer Behavior
◾Financial Records
 
Specific questions addressed:
1. How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?
2. Are there any peak times for sales activity?
3. What is the total sales revenue for each month?
4. How do sales vary across different store locations?
5. What is the average price/order per person?
6. Which products are the best selling in terms of quantity and revenue?
7. How do sales vary by product category and type?
 
Key Insights:
◾Sales peak on Mondays, with 10 AM being the busiest time.
◾The top-selling categories are Coffee, Tea, Drinking Chocolate, and Bakery.
◾The dashboard offers a real-time view of key metrics, driving actionable decisions.
 
This project sharpened my data analysis, visualization, and decision-making skills, and I’m thrilled to apply these learnings moving forward!
